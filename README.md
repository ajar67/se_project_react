## Project Name
WTWR (What to Wear?)

## Project Description
The idea of the application is pretty simple - we make a call to an API, which then responds with the daily weather forecast. We collect the weather data, process it, and then based on the forecast, we recommend suitable clothing to the user.

## Updates
I want to improve this website to make sure no more than one of the same items appear in the clothing section.
